# **Global-Insights-Analyzing-Countries-with-Panda**s

- This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on the "Countries of the World" dataset, using Pandas to uncover insights and patterns in global socio-economic data.
- The analysis aims to provide a deeper understanding of various metrics such as population density, GDP per capita, literacy rates, and more across different countries and continents.

#**Dataset Information**
- Dataset: Countries of the World
- Columns: Country, Region, Population, Area (sq. mi.), GDP ($ per capita), Literacy (%), Climate, and more.
- Total Columns: 20

#**Objectives**
- The primary goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive analysis of global data, drawing meaningful insights that can inform understanding of world demographics, economies, and environments. This project serves as an educational tool for practicing data analysis using Pandas in Python.

 # **EDA**

- The exploratory data analysis (EDA) for the "Countries of the World" dataset was performed using Python's Pandas library. This analysis involved several key steps to ensure the dataset was clean, well-structured, and insightful:

#**Data Loading and Initial Inspection:**
- Loaded the dataset using Pandas and performed an initial inspection to understand its structure and content.
- Displayed summary statistics to get an overview of the data distribution and identify any anomalies.
 
#**Data Cleaning:**
- Handled Missing Values: Replaced empty strings and other placeholders with NaN and applied imputation or removal strategies as necessary.
- Corrected Data Types: Converted columns with numeric values stored as strings to appropriate data types, such as integers and floats, to facilitate analysis.
- Decimal Standardization: Ensured decimal consistency across numeric fields by replacing commas with periods.

#**Feature Engineering:**
- Continent Extraction: Created a new column for continents based on region data to enable continent-level analysis.
- Population Density Categories: Added a categorical column to classify countries into low, medium, and high population density categories.
- Climate Classification: Converted numeric climate codes into descriptive categories (e.g., Tropical, Arid, Temperate).

#**Data Analysis:**
- Statistical Summaries: Calculated descriptive statistics for key indicators such as GDP per capita, literacy rates, and infant mortality.
- Comparative Analysis: Explored relationships between various features, such as GDP and literacy rates, and conducted continent-wise comparisons.
- Trend Identification: Identified countries with extreme values (e.g., highest GDP, largest population) to understand outliers and trends.

#**Data Visualization:**
- Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations that illustrate trends, distributions, and relationships within the dataset.
- Plotted histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots to visually represent the findings from the analysis.
