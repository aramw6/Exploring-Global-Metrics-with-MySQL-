#MySQL

##Key Components of the Analysis:

#Data Preview and Overview:

- View the entire dataset and describe its structure.
- Count the number of rows to understand dataset size.

#Data Cleaning:

- Decimal Cleaning: Replaced commas with periods for numerical consistency.
- Handling Missing Values: Converted empty strings to NULL for accurate analysis.

#Data Type Conversion:

- Converted appropriate columns to integer and float data types.

#Feature Engineering:

- Added a column for GDP per capita to enhance economic analysis.
- Created categorical columns for population density and climate to facilitate categorical analysis.
- Extracted continent information from region data for geographical insights.

#SQL Queries and Analysis:

- Identified countries with the highest and lowest populations.
- Analyzed the largest and smallest countries by land area.
- Determined top countries by GDP and assessed GDP growth.
- Examined average population density across countries.
- Found countries with the highest infant mortality rates.
- Analyzed average literacy rates by region.
- Investigated countries with the lowest mobile phone usage.
- Assessed birth and death rates by continent.
- Explored literacy rate variations across continents.
- Counted total countries in the dataset.
- Calculated total population by region.
- Analyzed population density trends.
- Identified countries with the longest coastlines.
- Found countries with the most and least net migration.
- Examined continents with the most and least migration.
- Calculated average GDP per capita by continent.
- Identified countries with the highest GDP per capita within each continent.
- Analyzed distribution of population density categories.
- Investigated climate distribution across continents.
